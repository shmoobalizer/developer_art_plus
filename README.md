# Developer Art+
Developer Art+ is a Minecraft resource pack for those who prefer the older style of Minecraft textures. 

<br>
<b>(this pack must be used over top of the "Programmer Art" pack if you wish to use it in versions after 1.13.2)

(if you are using the Bedrock Edition, you need to have the "Classic Textures" pack applied below this pack)</b>

<br>
Beginning in the 1.13 and later updates, Mojang has hired a new texture artist for Minecraft, this has resulted in the style of the Minecraft textures completely changing.


In the 1.14 and future updates, they have added a tab in the resource pack menu to revert any pre-1.14 textures to their originals, however, Mojang has stated that future textures will not be supported with the original style, this resource pack aims to change that, and in this pack, any textures created which do not fit with the original style will be changed so that they do.

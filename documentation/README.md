some textures may be missing documentation, this may be because:

 - I have not gotten around to writing it.
 
 - I feel documentation is not necessary, 
  either because the texture was made entirely from scratch, 
  or because the genesis is obvious or too simple to document.
  
 - I cannot recall how the texture was created.

if you use this documentation to aid in the creation of textures 
which are included in a publicly available resource pack, you agree 
to provide credit to the Developer Art+ project and/or it's creator for 
the textures in question.
